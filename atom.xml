    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is a test of the Rails Tutorial News feed. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Broadcast_System#Later_test_pattern">This is only a test.</a>) Since the Rails Tutorial News feed is (or, rather, was) hosted at Posterous, which is shutting down, I&#8217;ve moved it over to a new location. This post is written in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, and the site is produced with <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> and <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>. The generated static site is hosted at <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m making this test post to make sure everything is working. If all goes well, the post will show up in your feed reader or email inbox (depending on your subscription preferences). Because of the new XML feed generated by Jekyll, it&#8217;s also likely that many feed readers will show sixteen or so unread posts. I apologize in advance for the noise; unfortunately, this is the inevitable cost of the changeover. This post is the only one that&#8217;s actually new, so you can just mark all the other posts as read.</p>

<p>Now back to our <a href="http://railstutorial.org/book">regularly scheduled program</a>.</p>

    <id>http://news.railstutorial.org/rails-security-fixes-version-upgrade</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve just upgraded the <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> to use Rails&nbsp;3.2.11, which contains two important security fixes (one for <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/rubyonrails-security/DCNTNp_qjFM">SQL injection</a> and one for <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rubyonrails-security/61bkgvnSGTQ/discussion">parameter parsing</a>). The latest versions of the online book, ebooks, and sample application all now reflect this change.</p>
<p>It is critical to upgrade all of your production applications as soon as possible. The easiest way to do this is to edit your <tt>Gemfile</tt> and change the Rails gem version from <tt>&#8216;3.2.x&#8217;</tt> to <tt>&#8216;3.2.11&#8217;</tt>. Then run</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>$ bundle update rails &amp;&amp; bundle install</pre></div>
</div>

<p>to apply the update. (If you&#8217;re running Rails 3.1.x, 3.0.x, or 2.3.x, there are security patches for those branches as well, as detailed in the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rubyonrails-security/61bkgvnSGTQ/discussion">parameter parsing post</a>.)</p>

    <id>http://news.railstutorial.org/programmer-training-academies</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Programmers in general, and Rails developers in particular, continue to be in strong demand, and several excellent in-person training courses have sprung up to help meet the need, including <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">Dev Bootcamp</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/WnmFTS">App Academy</a> in San Francisco, <a href="http://www.starterleague.com/">The Starter League</a> (formerly Code Academy) in Chicago, and <a href="http://hackerschool.com/">Hacker School</a> in New York. (I&#8217;m pleased to note that all four have used the <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> as part of their curriculum at one time or another.) Such programs typically aren&#8217;t cheap (although Hacker School is free), but the people I&#8217;ve talked to who  have gone through them say they are a good  investment.</p>
<p>Dev Bootcamp doesn&#8217;t appear to have any openings right now, but both <a href="http://bit.ly/WnmFTS">App Academy</a> and <a href="http://www.starterleague.com/">The Starter League</a> have openings for their classes starting on January&nbsp;7, and <a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/">Hacker School</a> is accepting applications for its winter batch until January&nbsp;1. If you&#8217;re interested in taking your web development skills to the next level, I recommend checking them out. (<em>Note</em>: While I have no formal relationship with any of the groups mentioned, I know people at all four places, and <a href="http://bit.ly/WnmFTS">App Academy</a> pays referral bonuses if you end up attending.)</p>

<li>If you want a Kindle version, <a href="http://railstutorial.org/#buy">buy directly from railstutorial.org</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a quick update on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321832051/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0321832051&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=therubonraitu-20">print edition of the Ruby on Rails Tutorial, 2nd Edition</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=therubonraitu-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321832051" border="0" height="1" alt="" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" />. I&#8217;ve been notified by several readers that, despite the discount I negotiated at a non-Amazon retailer, in fact the print edition of the book is cheapest at Amazon. Having spent a week trying and failing to negotiate a bigger discount, I&#8217;ve decided that sending people to Amazon is best. (Please accept my apologies if you bought a copy at the (slightly) higher price; send me an <a href="http://railstutorial.org/contact">email</a> and I&#8217;ll do my best to make it up to you.)</p>
<p>This change in retailer also affords us an opportunity, as the book&#8217;s star rating at Amazon is currently being dragged down by several obsolete one-star reviews dating from the book&#8217;s <a href="http://news.railstutorial.org/do-not-buy-the-print-version-of-the-ruby-on-r">blown first printing</a>. Now that the corrected second printing is out, I would deeply appreciate it if you could <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321832051/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0321832051&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=therubonraitu-20">leave a review at Amazon.com</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=therubonraitu-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321832051" border="0" height="1" alt="" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" /> to help counterbalance these outdated bad reviews. (Of course, maybe you think the book deserves its one-star ratings, in which case&mdash;<em>ouch</em>.)</p>
<p>Finally, I&#8217;d like to note that the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/#buy">Rails Tutorial ebook bundle</a> includes a MOBI format for Kindle. I&#8217;ve had reports that the formatting is nicer than the &#8220;official&#8221; version at Amazon, and my version comes with free updates and bugfixes, so I recommend buying directly from railstutorial.org.</p>

    <link href="http://news.railstutorial.org/new-epub-and-mobi-versions-of-the-ruby-on-rails-tutorial/"/>
    <updated>2012-08-27T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://news.railstutorial.org/new-epub-and-mobi-versions-of-the-ruby-on-rails-tutorial</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m pleased to announce the immediate availability of EPUB and MOBI versions of the Ruby on Rails Tutorial, 2nd Edition, in addition to the original PDF. All three formats are 100% DRM-free. This is a FREE UPGRADE for purchasers of the 2nd edition PDF or PDF/screencast bundle. Simply search your mail program for &#8220;Rails Tutorial purchase&#8221; to find the email with the download link, and then re-download the relevant ZIP file. New customers who buy the ebook or ebook/screencast bundle will also get the new formats at no additional charge:<p /><a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/#buy">http://ruby.railstutorial.org/#buy</a><p />The production of these ebook formats is due to popular demand, but requires a brief rant.<p> 

  <p><strong>&lt;rant&gt;</strong>The EPUB and MOBI formats allow much less control over visual appearance and formatting than PDF does. This makes them particularly ill-suited to technical books, but they have significant limitations even for books consisting only of text. <em>Type is a visual medium.</em> EPUB and MOBI, while preserving content, undermine form. Nevertheless, they do offer certain compensating conveniences; thus, the present announcement.<strong>&lt;/rant&gt;</strong></p>

  <p>As noted above, if you already bought the 2nd edition of the Rails Tutorial PDF, just re-download the book ZIP file to get the new formats. If you haven&#8217;t bought it yet, maybe this will sweeten the deal enough for you to pull the trigger. Get them while they&#8217;re hot: <p /><a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/#buy">http://ruby.railstutorial.org/#buy</a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The <a href="http://news.railstutorial.org/print-edition-of-the-ruby-on-rails-tutorial-b">corrected second printing of the print edition</a> is now available.</p>
<p>The print version of the Ruby on Rails Tutorial, 2nd edition, has recently been released, and this is a warning not to buy it, at least not yet.<p />You might be tempted to think this is some kind of clever reverse-psychology marketing strategy, but alas it is not: the print book&#8217;s source code listings have been hopelessly mangled, with all angle brackets, curly braces, and quotes inexplicably omitted. This makes the source listings worse than useless. (The <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/book">online HTML book</a> and <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/#buy">ebooks</a> are unaffected and remain correct as before.)</p>
<p>I have alerted the publisher to the problem; how they&#8217;ll respond remains to be seen, but my hope is that it will involve a recall, correction, and re-issue. As a result, I hope and expect this to be fixed eventually. I plan to send out an announcement when it is. <strong>UPDATE:</strong> The plan is to freeze the current inventory and make a corrected second printing. I&#8217;d like to thank the publisher for their quick response.</p>
<p>In the meantime, <em>do not buy</em> the print version of the Ruby on Rails Tutorial until the second printing is available. Please accept my apologies for any inconvenience.</p>

This new edition has been specially optimized for e-readers such as Kindle and iPad; you can download a sample PDF here:<p /><a href="http://railstutorial.org/samples?file=rails_tutorial_2nd_edition_sample.pdf">http://railstutorial.org/samples?file=rails_tutorial_2nd_edition_sample.pdf</a><p />Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s new in the 2nd edition:<p /><a href="http://railstutorial.org/#new">http://railstutorial.org/#new</a><p />I&#8217;d especially like to thank the many readers who reported errors in the online version of the 2nd edition.<p />I&#8217;d also like to announce the launch of access to the 2nd edition screencasts. Right now this consists of Lessons 1 &amp; 2, along with two short screencasts on installation and advanced setup. Anyone who buys the screencasts now will get each new screencast as it&#8217;s produced, as well as the 1st edition screencasts in their entirety. I&#8217;m planning to increase the price to $125 once they&#8217;re done, but until then they are available for $95. You can find them on the Rails Tutorial home page:<p /><a href="http://railstutorial.org/">http://railstutorial.org/</a><p />I&#8217;m offering a 20% discount using the coupon code &#8220;rt2ndEd&#8221; (expires at the end of April).</p>
<p>As a heads-up, progress on the new screencasts will probably be slow for the next week or so, as I&#8217;ll be in Austin, Texas, for <a href="http://railsconf2012.com/">RailsConf 2012</a>. I&#8217;ll be speaking on Monday afternoon (4/23) on &#8220;Rails-flavored Ruby&#8221; (based on Chapter 4 of the Rails Tutorial book), and I&#8217;ll be around through the end of the conference. If any of you will be in attendance and would like to make good on the book&#8217;s <a href="http://railstutorial.org/book#license">Beerware License</a>, now&#8217;s your chance. ;-)</p>

    <id>http://news.railstutorial.org/rails-tutorial-sample-screencast-video-timely-feedback-requested-</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m gearing up for production on the second edition of the Rails Tutorial screencasts, and I&#8217;ve posted a sample video showing the setup I&#8217;m planning to use. I&#8217;m going to start screencasting within a few days, so now&#8217;s your chance to give me feedback (at <a href="mailto:admin@railstutorial.org">admin@railstutorial.org</a>) before the screencast train leaves the station.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the sample video:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/rails-tutorial-samples/rails_tutorial_2nd_ed_sample_video.mov.zip">Rails Tutorial 2nd edition sample video</a></p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I&#8217;ve also included a second video at a slightly different resolution.</p>
<p>These are some of the items I&#8217;d like to get feedback on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Video.</strong> Is the video crisp? Are the size and format OK?</li>
<li><strong>Sound.</strong> Is the sound clear? Is the volume good?</li>
<li><strong>Screen resolution.</strong> The video&#8217;s resolution is 1344x756, which uses the standard HD aspect ratio of 16:9 while still fitting on the screen of my MacBook Air. Let me know if it doesn&#8217;t look good on your system. (If this resolution doesn&#8217;t work, I might have to buy a new computer, which I&#8217;d really rather avoid&hellip;)</li>
<li><strong>Applications and workflow.</strong> I&#8217;m planning to use iTerm and Sublime Text as the principal development tools. I&#8217;m 95% likely to stick with those, but let me know if you violently disagree with either choice. <em>Note</em>: The main reason for switching to Sublime Text from TextMate (the editor used in the first edition) is that it&#8217;s comparably good while also being cross-platform.</li>
<li>The video includes some other details, so please watch it all the way through if you&#8217;re planning to comment. (It&#8217;s about 11 minutes long.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Any other observations or suggestions are greatly appreciated (<a href="mailto:admin@railstutorial.org">admin@railstutorial.org</a>), especially if they arrive within the next couple of days. Thanks!</p>

    <link href="http://news.railstutorial.org/the-ruby-on-rails-tutorial-now-with-twitter-s-bootstrap/"/>
    <updated>2012-03-09T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://news.railstutorial.org/the-ruby-on-rails-tutorial-now-with-twitter-s-bootstrap</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Due to <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3568921">popular demand</a>, I have prepared a new version of the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> using Twitter&#8217;s <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a> framework. The result, which represents the final draft of the 2nd edition, can be found here:</p>
<p><a href="http://railstutorial.org/book?version=3.2">http://railstutorial.org/book?version=3.2</a></p>
<p>This is a substantial revision, involving significant code changes,  new  mockups, and new screenshots. As usual, bug and typo reports are   welcome (<a href="mailto:admin@railstutorial.org">admin@railstutorial.org</a>). Once it looks like the kinks have  been worked out, I&#8217;ll release  a full PDF of the 2nd edition.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to thank reader <a href="https://twitter.com/colmtuite">Colm Tuite</a> for his excellent work in helping to convert the book&#8217;s sample app to Bootstrap. I&#8217;d also like to thank Thomas McDonald for his outstanding work on the <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/bootstrap-sass">bootstrap-sass</a> gem.</p>
<p>Since some readers might find themselves stuck in the middle of the pre-Bootstrap version, I have included a copy here:</p>
<p><a href="http://railstutorial.org/book?version=3.1">http://railstutorial.org/book?version=3.1</a></p>
<p>Otherwise, I suggest using the latest version:</p>
<p><a href="http://railstutorial.org/book?version=3.2">http://railstutorial.org/book?version=3.2</a></p>
<p>Thanks to all those who encouraged me to make this change. It was a lot of work, but based on reader feedback I&#8217;m confident that it&#8217;s the right move. Bootstrap is an excellent CSS and UI framework, and I&#8217;m excited to have it be part of the Rails Tutorial.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A full draft of the <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book?version=3.2"><em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em></a>, 2nd Edition, is now available. This draft includes previously unreleased versions of <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/chapters/user-microposts?version=3.2#top">Chapter 10</a>, &#8221;<a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/chapters/user-microposts?version=3.2#top">User microposts</a>&#8221;, and <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/chapters/following-users?version=3.2#top">Chapter 11</a>, &#8221;<a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/chapters/following-users?version=3.2#top">Following users</a>&#8221;. (As noted in the <a href="http://news.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-second-edition-updated">original announcement</a>, the new edition has eleven chapters, whereas the first edition had twelve, with a bonus Chapter 13 on Rails 3.1. Since the new edition is based on Rails 3.2, the bonus chapter is superfluous, and the new <tt>has_secure_password</tt> method allowed further consolidation from twelve chapters down to eleven.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to thank again all the readers who have reached out with suggestions and bug reports. Please <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/contact">keep them coming</a>. Once people have had time to read the newly released chapters, I plan to incorporate new feedback and then begin offering PDF sales of the new edition, which should happen within a few weeks. I also plan to start producing the new screencast series shortly. As noted before, these new products will be paid upgrades, but current customers will receive coupon codes good for substantial discounts. For answers to other Frequently Asked Questions, please see the FAQ in the <a href="http://news.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-second-edition-updated">original announcement</a>.</p>
