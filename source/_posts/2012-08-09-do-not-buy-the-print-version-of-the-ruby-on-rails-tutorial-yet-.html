title: Do not buy the print version of the Ruby on Rails Tutorial (yet)
published: true
---
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The <a href="http://news.railstutorial.org/print-edition-of-the-ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book/">corrected second printing of the print edition</a> is now available.</p>
<p>The print version of the Ruby on Rails Tutorial, 2nd edition, has recently been released, and this is a warning not to buy it, at least not yet.<p />You might be tempted to think this is some kind of clever reverse-psychology marketing strategy, but alas it is not: the print book's source code listings have been hopelessly mangled, with all angle brackets, curly braces, and quotes inexplicably omitted. This makes the source listings worse than useless. (The <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/book">online HTML book</a> and <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/#buy">ebooks</a> are unaffected and remain correct as before.)</p>
<p>I have alerted the publisher to the problem; how they'll respond remains to be seen, but my hope is that it will involve a recall, correction, and re-issue. As a result, I hope and expect this to be fixed eventually. I plan to send out an announcement when it is. <strong>UPDATE:</strong> The plan is to freeze the current inventory and make a corrected second printing. I'd like to thank the publisher for their quick response.</p>
<p>In the meantime, <em>do not buy</em> the print version of the Ruby on Rails Tutorial until the second printing is available. Please accept my apologies for any inconvenience.</p>
