I'm pleased to announce the availability of a [Chinese translation of the Ruby on Rails Tutorial](http://about.ac/rails-tutorial-2nd-cn/). I'd like to thank translator Andor Chen for his outstanding work. I deserve none of the credit; Andor reached out to me and asked if it was OK to translate the book, and I happily agreed. (All I did was contribute a [short preface](http://about.ac/rails-tutorial-2nd-cn/).) With my blessing, Andor is also offering ebook sales of the translation, the proceeds of which go directly to him. If you are a Chinese speaker, please [check it out](http://about.ac/rails-tutorial-2nd-cn/)!
