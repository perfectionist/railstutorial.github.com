title: New EPUB and MOBI versions of the Ruby on Rails Tutorial
published: true

<p>I'm pleased to announce the immediate availability of EPUB and MOBI versions of the Ruby on Rails Tutorial, 2nd Edition, in addition to the original PDF. All three formats are 100% DRM-free. This is a FREE UPGRADE for purchasers of the 2nd edition PDF or PDF/screencast bundle. Simply search your mail program for "Rails Tutorial purchase" to find the email with the download link, and then re-download the relevant ZIP file. New customers who buy the ebook or ebook/screencast bundle will also get the new formats at no additional charge:<p /><a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/#buy">http://ruby.railstutorial.org/#buy</a><p />The production of these ebook formats is due to popular demand, but requires a brief rant.<p> 

  <p><strong>&lt;rant&gt;</strong>The EPUB and MOBI formats allow much less control over visual appearance and formatting than PDF does. This makes them particularly ill-suited to technical books, but they have significant limitations even for books consisting only of text. <em>Type is a visual medium.</em> EPUB and MOBI, while preserving content, undermine form. Nevertheless, they do offer certain compensating conveniences; thus, the present announcement.<strong>&lt;/rant&gt;</strong></p>

  <p>As noted above, if you already bought the 2nd edition of the Rails Tutorial PDF, just re-download the book ZIP file to get the new formats. If you haven't bought it yet, maybe this will sweeten the deal enough for you to pull the trigger. Get them while they're hot: <p /><a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/#buy">http://ruby.railstutorial.org/#buy</a></p>
