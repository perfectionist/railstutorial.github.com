This is a test post. Since the Rails Tutorial News feed is (or, rather, was) hosted at Posterous, which is shutting down, I've moved it over to a new location. The post is written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), and it's currently hosted at [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). 

I'm making this test post to make sure everything is working. If all goes well, the post will show up in your feed reader or email inbox (depending on your subscription preferences). Because of the new XML feed generated by Jekyll, it's also likely that many feed readers will show sixteen or so unread posts. I apologize in advance for the noise; unfortunately, this is the inevitable cost of the changeover. This post is the only one that's actually new, so you can just mark all the posts as read.
